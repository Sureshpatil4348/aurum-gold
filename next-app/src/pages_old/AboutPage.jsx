            <h2>The problem was never the strategy.</h2>
            <p>
              At Moneytize Trading Academy, we've worked with hundreds of traders over the years —
              and noticed the same problem, over and over. They understood the market, learned the
              concepts, and knew when to trade. But when it came to live trading, emotions took
              over. We realised the problem was never the strategy — it was the execution.

                  With over 12 years of experience in stocks, forex, and cryptocurrency markets, Nikhil
                  has dedicated his career to understanding how successful traders think and operate.
                  As the founder of Moneytize Trading Academy, a KHDA-approved trading institution in
                  Dubai, he has helped more than 800 traders build confidence through structured
                  education and real market experience. A certified financial analyst and liquidity
                  expert, his vision behind AURUM was simple — to build a trading system that helps
                  traders execute with discipline, reduce emotional decisions, and follow a structured
                  approach to the markets.
